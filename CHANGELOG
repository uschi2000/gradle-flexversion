CHANGELOG

Future Version
=======
-Breaking: printVersion task not automatically applied. Use addPrintVersionTask() to do so

0.4.0
=======
-Breaking: FlexVersion object now returned instead of string.
    * If the return value of flexVersion() is used somewhere expecting a string, call toString()
    * This gives the user the ability to pull pieces out of the version string without parsing it manually
-Possible breaking: All domains (no matter how determined) will have / converted to -

0.3.0
=======
-Custom environment variables (useful for build systems and environments where the workspace is in a detached head)
-Option to enforce a pattern for a domain

0.2.0
=======
-Initial release of flexversion
